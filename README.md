A program for teachers to enter grades and calculate averages. 

I followed a udemy course on python, and at the end of the course there was an assignment to make such a program. From there I made the program bigger, and added more functions to it. When I was busy making a GUI, it was getting a bit complicating with different functions and windows, so I decided to make a GitHub account.

All feedback to how improve my code, or ideas for new functions, are welcome.
